										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>I have a passion for machine learning, coding, and AI.</p>
									</header>
									<p>In 2020, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering Technology from the Rochester Institute of Technology. During my studies, I immersed myself in machine learning, teaching myself everything I could on the subject.</p>
									<p>My dedication led to an internship at the Center for Systems Biology, a multidisciplinary biotechnology research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. There, I developed novel image processing techniques based on machine learning to identify potentially cancerous cells in tissue sample images taken with digital holography.</p>
									<p>Since then, I have pursued research in reinforcement learning at the same lab. My work has involved fundamental questions about the nature of exploration in decision processes. In this pursuit my co-author and I developed a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06005">novel mathematical framework for agent behavior</a> and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07487">highly scalable finite differences algorithm</a> for deep reinforcement learning. Currently, I am investigating improvements to modern off-policy learning algorithms.</p>

									<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>I've spent my life working with computers and code. Here are a few of my proudest accomplishments.</p>

												<h4>Real-time Low-cost Lymphoma & Breast Cancer Detection</h4>
												<p>I designed, developed, and tested deep learning image processing methods to automatically detect and classify potentially cancerous cells in real-time from a digital hologram.
												   I developed a GUI for technicians to interact with my code and deployed it on a Raspberry Pi.
												   This technology is currently used in Botswana to provide low-cost cancer screenings for people who may otherwise be unable to afford them.
												   The development of this technology led to two publications in
												   <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0265-3">Nature</a> and
												   <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.8b03029">ACS Nano</a>.

												<h4>Rocket League Gym</h4>
												<p>My passion for gaming and reinforcement learning led me to co-author a mod and API for the popular Esport <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>,
												   enabling ML practitioners to control the game via Python as though it were a
												   <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a>-style learning environment.
												   We titled this project <a href="https://rlgym.org/">Rocket League Gym</a> (RLGym), and it has gained a large following of bot-makers.
												   Users of our project developed a high-level open-source bot called
												   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Nexto</a> with reinforcement learning.
												   Trained with crowd-sourced compute power, Nexto became so proficient that it caught the eye of popular YouTube content creators like
												   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhz5RSX0go">Sunless Khan</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAiJFnRFCk">Lethamyr</a>,
												   and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Rocket Sledge</a>.
												   Across all videos about Nexto, the RLGym community bot has accumulated over 1 million total views.

												<h4>A Scalable Finite Difference Method for Deep Reinforcement Learning</h4>
												<p>In my first author work, I developed a highly scalable distributed system to train reinforcement learning agents with a novel finite differences algorithm.
												   The platform architecture uses gRPC to facilitate communication between a central learning process and numerous connected remote worker processes.
												   The system is fully deterministic and integrated with Weights & Biases for hyperparameter sweeps and repeatable experiments.
												   My paper on this project can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07487">here</a>, and starter code for the scalable finite differences algorithm and an implementation of the generalized Novelty Search algorithm from my
												   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06005">prior research</a> can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AechPro/dfd-starter/tree/main">here</a>.
