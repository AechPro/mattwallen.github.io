										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>I have a passion for machine learning, coding, and AI.</p>
									</header>
									<p>In 2020 I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering Technology from the Rochester Institute of Technology. During that time I taught myself 
										everything I could about machine learning and was fortunate enough to be accepted for an internship at the Center for Systems Biology, a multi-discilinary
										bio-technology research lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital. There I developed novel image processing techniques based in machine learning to identify
										potentially cancerous cells in images of tissue samples taken with digital holography.
										<br>
										Since then I have been pursuing research in reinforcement learning as a researcher at the same lab. My work has involved tackling fundamental questions about
										the nature of exploration in decision processes, which led to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06005">novel mathematical framework about agent behavior</a>,
										and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07487">highly scalable finite differences algorithm</a> for deep reinforcement learning. I am currently investigating
										improvements to modern off-policy learning algorithms.

												<h4>Real-time Low-cost Lymphoma & Breast Cancer Detection</h4>
												<p>I designed, developed, and tested deep learning image processing methods to automatically detect and classify potentially cancerous cells in real-time 
													from a digital hologram. I developed a GUI for technicians to interact with my code and deployed it on a Raspberry Pi. This technology is currently used 
													in Botswana to provide low-cost cancer screenings for people who may otherwise be unable to afford them. The development of this technology led to two publications in 
													<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0265-3">Nature</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.8b03029">ACS Nano</a>

												<h4>Rocket League Gym</h4>
												<p>My passion for gaming and reinforcement learning led me to co-author a mod and API for the popular Esport <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a> which enables AI practitioners
													to control the game via Python as though it were an <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a>-style learning environment. We titled this project the <a href="https://rlgym.org/">Rocket League Gym</a> (RLGym),
													and it has gained a large following of interested bot-makers. Users of our project came together to develop a high-level open-source bot called
													<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Nexto</a> with reinforcement learning. This bot was trained with compute power that was crowd-sourced
													from our users and became so good at the game that it caught the eye of several popular YouTube content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhz5RSX0go">Sunless Khan</a>, 
													<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAiJFnRFCk">Lethamyr</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Rocket Sledge</a>, and more.
													Across all videos about Nexto, the RLGym community bot has accumulated over 1 million total views.

												<h4>A Scalable Finite Difference Method for Deep Reinforcement Learning</h4>
												<p>In my first-author work, I developed a highly scalable distributed system to train reinforcement learning agents with a novel finite differences algorithm. The architecture of the platform
													uses gRPC to facilitate communication between a central learning process and any number of connected remote worker processes. The system is fully deterministic and natively integrated with
													Weights & Biases to support hyperparameter sweeps and repeatable experiments. My paper about this project can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07487">here</a> and some starter code
													which includes both the scalable finite differences algorithm and an implementation of the generalized Novelty Search algorithm from my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06005 ">prior research</a>
													can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/AechPro/dfd-starter/tree/main">here</a>.
