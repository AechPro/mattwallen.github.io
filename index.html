										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>I have a passion for Machine Learning, coding, and AI.</p>
									</header>
									<p>In 2020 I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering Technology from the Rochester Institute of Technology. During that time I taught myself 
										everything I could about Machine Learning, and was fortunate enough to be accepted for an internship at the Center for Systems Biology, a multi-discilinary 
										bio-technology research lab at the Massachusetts General Hospital. There I developed novel image processing techniques to identify potentially cancerous cells
										in images of tissue samples taken with digital holography.
										<br>
										Since then I have been pursuing a first author work in Reinforcement Learning where I am tackling fundamental questions pertaining to the nature of exploration.
										This work has already lead to two pre-publications on arXiv that are available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01684">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06005">here</a>.

												<h4>Real-time Low-cost Lymphoma & Breast Cancer Detection</h4>
												<p>I designed, developed, and tested deep learning image processing methods to automatically detect and classify potentially cancerous cells in real-time 
													from a digital hologram. I developed a GUI for technicians to interact with my code and deployed it on a Raspberry Pi. This technology is currently used 
													in Botswana to provide low-cost cancer screenings for people who may otherwise be unable to afford them. The development of this technology led to two publications in 
													<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-018-0265-3">Nature</a> and <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.8b03029">ACS Nano</a>

												<h4>Rocket League Gym</h4>
												<p>My passion for gaming and Reinforcement Learning led me to co-author a mod and API for the popular Esport <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a> which enables AI practitioners 
													to control the game via Python as though it were an <a href="https://www.gymlibrary.ml/">Openai Gym</a>-style learning environment. We titled this project the <a href="https://rlgym.org/">Rocket League Gym (RLGym),</a> 
													and it has gained enough of a following that a few users of our project developed a high-level community-based bot called  
													<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Nexto</a> with Reinforcement Learning. This bot was trained with compute power that was crowd-sourced
													from our users and became so good at the game that it caught the eye of several popular YouTube content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhz5RSX0go">Sunless Khan</a>, 
													<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAiJFnRFCk">Lethamyr</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50">Rocket Sledge</a>, and more.
													Across all videos about Nexto, the RLGym community bot has accumulated over 1 million total views.

												<h4>Distributable Reinforcement Learning</h4>
												<p>I have developed multiple large-scale distributable computing platforms for Reinforcement Learning. While the first is still undergoing private development for a future publication, the second is
													publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/AechPro/distrib-rl">my GitHub</a> and provides a variety of useful tools for scientific computing. The architecture of the platform enables multiple 
													asynchronous machines to transmit data to Redis, where a learning algorithm can consume that data and compute updates to a policy.
